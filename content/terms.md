## Data Storage 

Nomie can be used in three different ways, one storing all data locally on the device only, another storing it in your own CouchDB Server, and lastly storing your data end-to-end encrypted in Firebase - which does require a paid subscription. 

## Subscriptions

Monthly installments are required for our subscription. Until you cancel your subscription, the monthly renewal payments will be automatically paid to the Payment Method you chose. To avoid invoicing of the next month's monthly price to the Payment Method you supplied, you must cancel your subscription before it renews each month. Any partial-month subscription period is not eligible for a refund.

### Nomie Cloud Accounts (Paid)

In order to use Nomie on multiple devices, or to leverage Nomie 6's API, you need a Nomie Cloud account, and a  subscription plan. In order to create a Nomie Cloud account, a valid email adress is required. Beyond your email address, all other data stored in Nomie cloud is fully encrypted by keys that only you can access. 

### Nomie Local (Free)

Data captured in Nomie Local, never leaves your device. Nomie Local, does not have access to the Nomie API, nor the ability to share data across multiple devices.

You agree, that when using Nomie Local, you will be responsible for generating backups of your data frequently, in the event that Apple or Google decided to clear our data to free up space - which can happen to Progressive Web Apps like Nomie. 

### CouchDB

You accept full responsibility for your own server and its security by using the CouchDB storage adapter. Nomie is not liable for any data exposed as a result of using your own CouchDB server.
